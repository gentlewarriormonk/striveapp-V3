# üó∫Ô∏è PROJECT_PLAN.md ‚Äì Strive (v1.0)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** March 29, 2025
**Status:** Active

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the high-level project plan for developing the Strive application. It breaks down the development into distinct modules (corresponding to Minimum Viable Product increments) based on the features defined in `MASTER_PRD.md`. The goal is to deliver value incrementally, starting with core daily execution features.

## 2. Development Phases & Modules

The project will be developed in the following phases/modules. Each module will have its own dedicated folder within `/feature_modules/` containing detailed planning documents (`MINI_PRD.md`, `FLOW.md`, `TECH_DECISIONS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`).

| Module ID          | Module Name                      | Status        | Description                                                                                                       | Target Features (from MASTER_PRD)                          |

## 3. Timeline & Milestones (High-Level)

*(Specific timelines TBD - This provides sequence)*

-   **Milestone 1:** Complete MVP 0 (Authentication working).
-   **Milestone 2:** Complete MVPs 1 & 2 (Core Task & Habit tracking functional).
-   **Milestone 3:** Complete MVPs 3 & 4 (Gamification & Dashboard integrated).
-   **Milestone 4:** Complete MVP 5 (Basic Group functionality working).
-   **Subsequent Milestones:** Target completion of Phase 2 & 3 modules based on priority and resources.

## 4. Development Workflow Reminder

-   Follow the Master Plan Framework v2.0.
-   Plan each module (`MINI_PRD`, `FLOW`, `TECH_DECISIONS`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN`) within its `/feature_modules/` subfolder using AI assistance in Cursor, referencing `MASTER_PRD.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
-   Use the module's `PROGRESS.md` checklist during implementation.
-   Implement code using AI assistance in Cursor, focusing on steps from the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN`.
-   Commit frequently to Git and push to the `striveapp-V3` remote repository.
-   Update the Status column in this document as each module progresses.

---

**Action:**

1.  Create a new file named `PROJECT_PLAN.md` in the root of your `striveapp` folder (alongside `MASTER_PRD.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`).
2.  Copy and paste the content above into this file and save it.
3.  **Important:** Use Git to commit this new file:
    *   Open the terminal in Cursor.
    *   Run `git add PROJECT_PLAN.md`
    *   Run `git commit -m "Add initial PROJECT_PLAN.md outlining modules"`
    *   Run `git push` (you don't need `-u origin main` anymore as the tracking is set up).

**Next Step After This:**

With the high-level planning documents (`MASTER_PRD`, `ARCHITECTURE`, `PROJECT_PLAN`) in place, we are ready to start planning the *first specific module*: **`00_auth_setup`**.

This involves:

1.  Creating the folder `/feature_modules/00_auth_setup/`.
2.  Creating the planning documents (`MINI_PRD.md`, `FLOW.md`, `TECH_DECISIONS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`) *inside* that folder using the templates from `/planning_templates/`.
3.  Using the AI agent in Cursor to help fill out the details for *each* of those documents specifically for the Authentication module.
