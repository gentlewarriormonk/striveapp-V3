# ðŸ“„ MASTER Product Requirements Document (PRD) â€“ Strive (v1.0)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** March 29, 2025
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Name
Strive (Domain: striveapp.io)

### 1.2 Vision
To create a minimalist, intuitive, and powerful personal productivity system that seamlessly integrates habit tracking, task/project management, gamified motivation, and (eventually) AI-driven assistance, helping users achieve meaningful progress in both personal and professional contexts.

### 1.3 Purpose
Strive aims to reduce the friction in daily planning and execution by providing clear visibility into tasks and habits, fostering motivation through streaks and XP, and supporting focused work. It merges the motivational aspects of habit tracking (from the original Strive concept) with effective task management (inspired by VoiceFlow and user needs), accessible via a clean GUI and planned voice/AI interactions.

### 1.4 Target Audience
-   **Individuals:** Seeking a unified system for personal habits, tasks, and goals.
-   **Students:** Tracking academic tasks, study habits, and personal development goals.
-   **Professionals/Freelancers:** Managing daily tasks, deadlines, personal habits, and potentially lightweight project tracking.
-   **Informal Groups (Friends, Family, Clubs):** Sharing progress (streaks, XP) and providing mutual accountability and encouragement within a group context.
    *(Note: The initial focus is on individual productivity, with group features added early but kept simple.)*

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Product Goals
-   Develop a reliable and intuitive platform for tracking daily tasks and habits.
-   Implement a motivating gamification system based on streaks, XP, and tier progression.
-   Provide clear views for daily planning ("Today") and upcoming tasks.
-   Enable basic grouping for shared visibility and accountability.
-   Establish a foundation for future project management, voice control, and AI coaching features.
-   Ensure a high-quality, minimalist, and frictionless user experience.

### 2.2 Business Goals (High-Level)
-   Achieve strong user adoption and retention within target segments.
-   Validate the core value proposition of integrated task/habit tracking with gamification.
-   Create a scalable platform capable of supporting future premium/business features.
-   Build a foundation for a potentially profitable SaaS application.

## 3. Core Principles & Approach

-   **Minimalism:** Prioritize simplicity and clarity; avoid feature bloat.
-   **Intuitive UX:** Design interfaces that are easy to understand and use with minimal friction.
-   **Modularity (Master Plan Framework):** Develop features incrementally in well-defined modules.
-   **AI-Assisted Development:** Leverage integrated AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro in Cursor) for planning, scaffolding, code generation, testing, and review, following defined guidelines.
-   **Start Fresh:** Build upon concepts from previous projects but implement with a clean codebase.
-   **Dark Mode First:** Prioritize a polished dark mode experience based on the defined Strive aesthetic, with light mode as a secondary goal.
-   **Phased Rollout:** Focus on core daily execution features first, layering more complex functionality (project management, advanced AI) later.
